# Hey

Hello reader, I am Sanjaay, also known as Whippingdot, who likes coding. I am a kid who is still learning, but eh I try to do challenges too. This is my second year of [AOC](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Last Year

Last year I teamed up with [@CSharpIsGud](https://replit.com/@CSharpIsGud) and [@TsunamiOrSumth](https://repl.it/@TsunamiOrSumth) to solve the [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1) to [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/2) challenges. We kind of gave up on the 8th week cause it got too complicated, but this year I hope to achieve more than day 8. This year I mainly strive to finish all the challenges and not give up - I don't really care if I get on the leaderboards or not this year (that is next year's challenge). If you would be willing to help me if I have questions or such, please create an issue on this repo or ping me on the replit discord (my username is @Whippingdot but my nickname changes frequently).

Also, I have not touched last year's code - therefor error messages and random READMEs - so some things might not work but you don't need last years stuff anyway (I think).

## Running the Files

For some reason whenever I run last year's programs (I haven't tried this year's yet) on replit it works, but on VSCode nothing works. I was using [@Coder100](https://replit.com/@Coder100) 's way of running the program last year in which it tells you how long it took the run the program and it also let you run any of the days by just uncommenting a line, but as I said on VSCode this does not work and this year I am using VSCode so for now I have gave up on using that method and I am just running the files separately. If you could help me fix the problem with running the files I would really appreciate it!

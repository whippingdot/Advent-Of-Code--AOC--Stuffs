Well new problem - the stoi is not working and I cannot find a way to convert my strings to integers. I can't do anything without this. AAAHHH fix this!

Okay now so i have to properly implement the if statements (this is such bad code quality) and maybe if time permits also do a little bit of actual ADDING THE BINGO SHEETS instead of ADDING THE FIRST LINE!

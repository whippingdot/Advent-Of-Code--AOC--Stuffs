Create three dimensional array and input values in that using **a normal loop.** When getting the first line (i=0) put it into a separate array for bingo calling numbers. After defining the 3D array by looping through every line and stacking the bingo sheets, do the actual part of finding and marking the bingo sheets with 0 or x in place of the number. Also check for a full column or row of x's or 0s.

# Hey

Hello reader, I am Sanjaay, also known as Whippingdot, who likes coding. I am a kid who is still learning, but eh I try to do challenges too. This is my third year of [AOC](https://adventofcode.com/). I do the AOC challenges in C++ by the way! (copied from last year lol)

## Previous Years

Two years ago I had teamed up with a homeschooled kid named CSharpIsGud. He was a great friend but as out conversations slowly dwindled and stopped I wasn't able to get in contact with him again. I tried contacting him last year to work with him again but I could not contact him properly. Hopefully in a few years I meet him online again and am able to work on another AOC with him as he was a great friend.

This year though I am working with a real life friend of mine on this. We are competing to see who can finish more days, him on JS and me on C++. This man is using GitHub for the first time so he might be a little rusty and this is his first actual coding problem competition I think but I know he is amazing at coding and I can't wait to see who can finish more days. AOC always makes my December (even though i gives me stress and depress-) so I hope this year is the same!

Last year I had ideas for Day 4 that my dad gave me and I realized from the bat my main problem was with handling 2D arrays. Arrays in C++ are just weird and making Vectors 2D is a pain so until I learn proper methods of 2D List handling I will struggle this year too. Let us hope I figure it out!

## Running the Files

There is now a bash script added called 'Compile.sh'. You can run this script using `bash Compile.sh` after going into the 'aoc' folder of 2021. You can continuously change the name of the file being run in that bash file to run different files. I don't use it myself and haven't tested it much but if you want you can try it out and run my code. I do think it is easier if you just import both the header file ('aoc.h') and the C++ file and run them instead of going through a big head-ache...

### BYE

Wish me luck - I'll need it
